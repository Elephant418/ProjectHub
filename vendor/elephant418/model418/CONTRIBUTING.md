CONTRIBUTING
==========

If you don't know much about pull request, you can read [the Github article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).



Pull requests Guidelines
----------

Pull requests are highly appreciated. Here are some guidelines to help:

1. **Solve a problem**. Features are great, but even better is cleaning-up and fixing issues.
2. **Write tests**. This helps preserve functionality as the codebase grows.
3. **Small > Big**. Better to have a few small PRs that address specific parts of the code.



Code Guidelines
----------

Your code must:

1. Works with PHP 5.4 and later
2. Follow the [PSR2 standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)
3. Be accompanied by passing [phpunit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/) tests.



Pull requests Workflow
----------

1. Fork the library repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **v1.x** branch
